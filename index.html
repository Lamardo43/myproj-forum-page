<h2>Can't Stop Cleaning at Home - Is it a Disorder?</h2>

<p class="commentText post">Girls, help with some good advice. I suspect I have OCD. I clean the house
every day, even if I've
been studying or working all day and feel extremely tired. I can't help it - I won't go to sleep
until I've mopped all the floors and dusted the entire apartment. Sometimes it takes 5 hours a day,
even though my apartment is only 33 square meters. If the day has been stressful, I still don't feel
satisfied after cleaning; it always seems like the house is dirty. What should I do? Is this a
reason to see a psychiatrist? Currently living alone, I can't imagine what it will be like when I
have a family. I'm 21, and I really suffer from these intrusive thoughts. People around me don't see
it as a problem and just think I'm a good housekeeper. My fiancé loves it, saying how great it is
that the house is always clean. I suffer a lot from this; I just want to be healthy. Thanks in
advance for your answers.</p>

<p class="commentText">Generally, OCD flourishes with anxiety. It's not about cleaning; you should
consider seeing a psychiatrist if possible.</p>

<p class="commentText">Everything is fine with you) Cleaning a little every day is nothing terrible.
You're not walking
around with a cloth in your hands searching for stains on the walls, right? It's good when the house
is clean.</p>
